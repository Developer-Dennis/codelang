            <h1> What is <span>Programming</span>?</h1>
            <p>Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you‚Äôve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe‚Äôs author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!</p>

                <p class="lang-info">What is JavaScript?
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                <h3 class="lang-name">Ruby</h3>
                <p class="lang-info">Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro ‚ÄúMatz‚Äù Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

                    He has often said that he is ‚Äútrying to make Ruby natural, not simple,‚Äù in a way that mirrors life.
                    
                    Building on this, he adds:</p>

                <h3 class="lang-name">Python</h3>
                <p class="lang-info">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

                <h3 class="lang-name">C++</h3>
                <p class="lang-info">C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.

                    A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study.</p>
